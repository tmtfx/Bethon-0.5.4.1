Python classes for BeOS C++ API, version 0.5.0.
	</H2><P>
If you're a Python programmer and <I> not </I> a C++ programmer, and
only want to use the modules, the worst problem is just documentation,
or lack thereof.  We have none, we rely entirely on the BeBook
documentation of the C++ API.  And there are some transforms between
that and this Python API that should fairly obvious to someone who
understands both, but maybe not if you only know Python.
	<P>
There is hope, though, since at least there are some example programs.
If anyone wants to contribute more example programs, incidentally,
that would be great.  There is also usually included with this
distribution a real application, maybe not the slickest thing in
the world but I use it.
	<P>
If you have used an older release, 0.4.2 or older, this one marks
a substantial change in that the Python 2.2 class/type integration
allows us to inherit directly from a Be API type, instead of using
a special bind() method to link the class instance up.  The old way
still works, and the new actually has some drawbacks - it can be
harder to find the right base class for a MessageReceived or whatever.
All the examples have been converted to the new style.
	<P>
Credits - I got some of the ideas in this system from a paper by
Jim Ahlstrom, though they've probably been perverted beyond
recognition and the resulting mess shouldn't reflect on him
at this point.
	<P>
	<H4>
Step one:  Python
	</H4><P>
Get Python.  I think at some point this could be a binary distribution,
including Python, but at present you have to get Python separately.
As of Bethon-0.5.0, Python 2.2 is required.  My Python 2.2 distribution
for BeOS includes binaries from version Bethon 0.5.0.
	<P>
I assume installation makes and uses /boot/home/config/lib/python2.2 and
a subdirectory plat-beos5.  I'm assuming BeOS 5.0.  That's what I have.
If anyone needs to work with 4.5, I may be able to help - should be mostly
just some changes in the API.  ``Improved'' distributions of 5.0 and
bootleg post-5.0 unreleased distributions seem to be a common source of
problems, and I can't help much with that.
	<P>
I use a file in the top directory "pythonversion" with one
line PYTHONVERSION=2.2, and the makefiles can find that.  You must
however keep build versions consistent, don't try to run old modules
with new interpeter or vice versa.
	<P>
PPC and Intel are both supported, of course.
	<P>
	<H4>
Step two:  Build these modules.
	</H4><P>
Cd to <CODE>base</CODE>, run <I>make</I>.
	<P>
Cd to <CODE>build</CODE>, run <I>make</I>.  Then <I>make install</I>, to
put the modules in the lib directory where python will look.
	<P>
Cd to <CODE>symbols</CODE>, run <I>make</I>.  Then <I>make install</I>, to
install the symbol modules for symbols like B_QUIT_REQUESTED.
	<P>
	<H4>
Step three:  Figure out what went wrong.
	</H4><P>
If it doesn't work, I would like to hear about.  There will be some
errors in the compile, for sure - a few things I do the compiler doesn't
like, plenty of functions that can't be compiled because we don't have
type support for them yet.
	<P>
	<H4>
The system.
	</H4></P>
Each module represents a BeOS API class.  The source is a .dx file,
using my own ad hoc notation.  This is compiled with a Python program,
"sg", to m4, a macro language that has been around for many years and
happens to be supported on BeOS.  m4 converts that to a .cpp C++ file,
to be compiled and linked as a shared library.
	<P>
There are 51 modules as I write this.  Should be easy to write more -
should be easier than it is!  See Dx.html for more on this.  Send
along anything you can bear to see included here - we already have
a few contributed modules.  It doesn't even have to work right.
Sometimes I can fix them.  Sometimes there's a problem that I have
to change the template compiler to fix, but if you wait for me to
run into the problem on my own, it could be long wait!  As I write
this I'm sitting on some other contributed modules that need more
thought than I have time for right now, that happens too.
	<P>
The module for a derived class can fall back on its base classes -
for example, the many BView descendants rely on the BView module for
methods like Bounds().  They do this at run time.  Virtual hook
functions are also inherited, but not at run time - they're just
pulled out of their respective .dx files at compile time.
