How to make a new module BSinkmodule.so
	</H2><P>
Each module starts with a <CODE> .dx </CODE> file that has to be written by
hand.
	<P>
First I read the .h into the editor, /boot/develop/headers/be/storage/Sink.h.
It's not enough like the .dx file to be exactly a starting point, but it's
at least a handy reference.  I will also need the Be Book reference at hand.
	<P>
The .dx file has a simple tab indented format.
	<P>
The "include" stanza should be fairly obvious.  The module's own include
may be the only one needed here, the compiler will let you know if not.
	<P>
The "class" stanza is where everything happens.  The class statement
itself might look like this:  "class Sink handler".  (Note, not BSink.)
"handler" is a keyword here, that classifies this object in general
terms.  The alternatives are "looper" and "abstract", neither of them
all that common, and "ref" which is the default.  BView subclasses are
all "handler", for example.
	<P>
The statements under "class" are all one kind or another of function
definition, except "base", which declares the base class(es).  Don't
spell out the whole inheritance tree - Window for example is a subclass
of Looper, and _not_ Handler.  A base class supplies its functions
and virtual functions, so the new BSink module adds only its unique
new functions.
	<P>
There may be a "constructor" statement, if there are any virtual functions.
Its "param" shows the parameters of the class constructor(s).  I omit any
constructor where I can't handle the types.  I haven't bothered with
BArchivable support, and I omit the usual constructor from BMessage.
Virtual functions listed in the "hooks" section of the BeBook page are
declared in "hook" statements.  (Not all virtual functions, only the hooks.)
Non-hook functions are just functions, to be called from Python - and
if a function is used both ways, it should be declared both ways (see
MessageReceived.)  In this case, use the optional "C++ name" parameter
to "function" to specify the base class, e.g. BHandler::MessageReceived,
to avoid infinite recursion.
	<P>
Then there will be a bunch of "function"s, the class methods.  Instead
of "param", these use "input", the arguments in the Python call.  There
often will be some remapping, and the "param" following "input" shows
this - if there's no "param", then the same argument list is presumed
to pass right through to C++.  For a "hook" function the relationship
is naturally inverted;  the "input" still declares the Python function's
parameters, and but they're created from the C++ parameter values
(and "input" still is the default for "param".)
	<P>
This part is very order dependent.  Start with "input".  If a "param"
is needed, it follows, plus any "return" and "status" statements.  Then
if there are any overloads with different parameter lists, more "input"
lines may follow.  They inherit the preceding "return" & "status" by
default, but of course not "param".  "return" is optional, default is
no (None) return.
	<P>
The parameter list is comma separated - not comma separated with optional
white space, just comma separated.  Types are declared with familiar C
notation, and position index - e.g., char*@1=0 means first parameter is
a string, but optional with default value NULL.  Parameter 0 is the
function return.  Position indices like &status_t%3 mean that a variable
of type status_t is passed to the C++ function to receive a return value,
and of course it's allocated within the interface call because Python
doesn't pass variables by reference like that.  Return values use the
% notation too.  "status" is usually the status_t return of the C++
function, and when declared as such it will be checked to see if an
exception should be raised.
	<P>
There are plenty of parameter lists that are too tricky for me yet.
To see a few of the more obscure notation tricks, see BFile.dx.
	<P>
There could easily be a few new incidental structs or classes that
BSink will need.  I've been handling these as tuples, rather than
making new Python types for everything.  That's all in sgrules.py,
which just needs to be edited to add the new struct - ``follow the
example of other structs.''  If the thing has a constructor, assignment
operator, etc., make it a CTorTuple, not just TupleBase.
	<P>
BSink will also probably introduce some int typedefs.  Defined a load
of these, already, in sgrules.py - look for "long".
	<P>
OK, that's more than anyone is going to read, anyway.  Good luck, have
fun, write if you get it to work!
