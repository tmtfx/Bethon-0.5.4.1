Sample programs.
	</H2><P>
A couple are Python versions of old Be sample programs, most are
fairly self evident.
<UL>
<LI><I> doodad </I><BR>
Best eye candy, has a few controls.  It also uses the <I>lay</I>
module for column/row self-sizing layout.
<LI><I> menu </I><BR>
Illustrates several kinds of menus.
<LI><I> script </I><BR>
Don't miss this subdirectory if you're interested in the BeOS scripting
system.
<LI><I> listnode </I><BR>
Give it a file name, it will print out the attributes - like the "listattr"
command, but also prints values.  
<LI><I> mailnode </I><BR>
I have used this to make BeMail-ish messages out of text files retrieved
via poplib.POP3.  Needs a sample message, you have to edit this program
to restore it to working condition.
<LI><I> dump_attr </I><BR>
Reads a file's attributes, saves them in a pickle string and writes them
to output, which you should redirect to a file.  <I>load_attr</I> can
reverse this process and put those attributes on any file.  You can
use the pickle module to get into that attribute list and modify it,
if you want.
<LI><I> bstructs.py </I><BR>
This file is generated by sgrules.py.  It makes Python classes for the
various struct tuples - the C++ modules expect and return tuples for 
any struct type that's not a Bxxx class with its own module (and that
includes BPoint and BRect, since they have no module.)  The
<I>bestructs.py</I> module is a hand written derivative of this that
extends the BRect class with Height and Width methods.
