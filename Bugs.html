<H2>System - issues like threads, storage etc.</H2><P>

	<H4>
Crash on quit
	</H4><P>
   Problem is at least much diminished, if 1) I create windows
from only the main thread, and 2) don't exit before the non-main threads
have finished.  This is probably a fact of life that is just much more
poignant in Python.  It can be kind of difficult to achieve #2.

C storage vs. Python
	</H4><P>
   What a mess.  Most functions take their data pointer, do what they
need and let it go.  Some, however, take the pointer and squirrel it away,
in which case it needs an incref to pin the Python version up.
This appears to be a case-by-case research project.
Other functions may later release the pointer, and we'd like to decref
at that point, but I can't bear to even think about that.
Maybe just RemoveChild() and the like, but basically anything that
overwrites or clears a pointer we made a reference for.
The "incref" option is duly noted for a few functions, probably not all
that need it.  A similar option "dup" is for cases where it seemed
better for one reason or another to make a copy.

Reference counts for wrap instances
	</H4><P>
    Need more research, but I have reason to suspect that there are
some extra references somewhere that keep the instance from ever
getting to refcount 0 once it has been bound - despite attempts
to unbind with bind(None).  Pretty sure some of them are actually
references to member functions.  I will fix this stuff if I figure
out how -- and the result may be inconvenient for you, if you have
been depending on this bug that allows your BWindow objects to
persist despite no apparent references!

Inheritance details
	</H4><P>
More virtual functions are now implemented in each derived class,
now automatic for "virtual" functions where before (in 0.3.0) it
had to be done by hand.  There certainly may be more virtual functions
that need to be declared as such in source/*.dx.

	<H4>
Interpreter lock over-use
	</H4><P>
   Think about eliminating the thread unlock/lock around some of the
function calls.  Most of them are fast and therefore don't need to
release the interpreter lock.  Don't have any idea how much advantage
this would be.  Since I am not hurting for performance, the incentive
is not strong.

Function stanza order errors
	</H4><P>
   Warn or something when missing return/status etc. in first fn of
multiple input overload, where return/status etc. was probably intended
to apply to all.

	<H4>
Parsing
	</H4><P>
   More tolerant whitespace handling.
	<P>
	<H4>
Unsupported types
	</H4><P>
    Array of char*, many of these in omitted BFont functions.  I think that
can be addressed with new type, in sgrules, in general zero terminated vs.
dimensioned.  (Arrives in 0.3.0, but some of those BFont functions are
probably going to have to be done by hand, in the end.)
	<P>
    BList, pattern, various other compound types.

	<H4>
Horrible coding mess
	</H4><P>
    Rewrite everything, maybe ditch m4.
