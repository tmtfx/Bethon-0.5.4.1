- scriptable.py

	Python instance whose attributes represent the scriptable
	application, readable & writable.

- browse

	List attributes.  Select an attribute that returns another
	scriptable messenger, get a new list window;  select an
	attribute with another kind of value, it's displayed.


I still haven't figured out what this is good for.  When I browse
Network, for example, I find only the current tab view.  What I
want, for my own use, is
  - start Network
  - select Services tab
  - invoke Restore
  - invoke Restart Networking
    - wait out alert
  - select Identity
  - invoke Clear
  - invoke Save
  - invoke Don't restart Networking

(OK, I no longer have to do that, thanks to "PC Card Wizard", but
take that as an example of programmatic access to interface controls.)

How do I select a tab?  How do I wait for the alert to finish?

And this stuff is not reliable, it's too easy to crash.  Needs work
to be any real use.
