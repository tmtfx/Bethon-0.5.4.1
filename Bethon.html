What's this about ``Bethon''?
	</H2><P>
Had to call it something.  I have been using "bpy" and
variations on that theme, but I got sick of "PY" as an ending.
Then I thought "BePython", but it proved too much work to type.
"Bethon" is easier, and it doesn't falsely imply that Python
is contained herein (it isn't, this is just a bunch of modules.)
	<P>
A Google search didn't turn up anything else at all in the
computer world with this name, just a lot of French names.
Bonjour, if you like it because it looks French, c'est OK.
It is "Be" as in Be, Inc. and "thon" as in Python, so pronounce
it accordingly.
