C++ wrapper for Python wrapper for C++ BeOS API
	</H2><P>
Here's a C++ Python main().  You can set application attributes as
per regular C++ application, like icon, single/multiple launch etc.
	<P>
In this example, the Python program is "hello".  That's set up in
Makefile, which defines C pre-processor symbols so you don't have
to edit the C++ program to make a different one for each program.
	<P>
The Makefile also loads attributes from a file - a goofy icon and
some other ordinary stuff.  The file is a Python ``pickle'' archive,
dumped from an executable file where I had defined these attributes
with FileTypes.  (I omitted the BEOS:TYPE attribute from the attributes,
though, that's the linker's job.)  There must be better ways to do it,
I'm just not very well informed on stuff like that.
	<P>
The easy way to do almost the same thing without any C++ file is
a BEOS:PPATH attribute on the Python program itself, pointing
to the python binary.  (That's what BAppFileInfo::SetAppHint() does.)
Then the program will be executed (interpreted) by python when
you select it from a Tracker window.  But the file's icon doesn't
show up in the dock that way.  I don't think it's necessarily a
good idea to do this routinely with every Python program -- in
many cases the 'edit this file' default will be more appropriate.
